<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Newborn Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The newborn ventilator market is primarily divided into invasive and non-invasive types. Invasive ventilation involves the use of endotracheal tubes inserted into the neonate's airway, providing controlled respiratory support for severe cases. Non-invasive ventilation, on the other hand, employs methods like CPAP or nasal cannulas, allowing for oxygen delivery without airway insertion, making it less traumatic for the infant. Both types are crucial in managing neonatal respiratory distress, ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation in vulnerable newborns.</p></p>
