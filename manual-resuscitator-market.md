<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manual Resuscitator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Inflating Resuscitator</li><li>Flow-Inflating Resuscitator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The manual resuscitator market is primarily divided into two types: self-inflating and flow-inflating resuscitators. Self-inflating resuscitators are portable devices that automatically refill with air after each use, allowing for quick and effective ventilation without an external gas source, making them suitable for emergencies. In contrast, flow-inflating resuscitators require a continuous flow of gas, typically from a cylinder or wall source, providing more control over ventilation but demanding more equipment. Both types are essential for effective manual ventilation during respiratory distress situations.</p></p>
